# WARP.md

This file provides guidance to WARP (warp.dev) when working with code in this repository.

Repository status (as of creation)
- No build, lint, or test configuration files were found.
- No README or project-specific rules files (CLAUDE.md, .cursor/rules, .cursorrules, .github/copilot-instructions.md) were found.
- The repository currently contains only a Git directory and no source files.

Commands
- None detected yet. Once language/tooling is added (e.g., package.json, pyproject.toml, go.mod, Makefile), update this section with the exact build, lint, and test commands, including how to run a single test.

Architecture overview
- No source files or directories were found, so there is no architecture to summarize yet. After source is added, summarize the high-level layout (services/modules/packages) and the primary data flows or integration points here.

Notes for future updates
- After you introduce a tech stack (e.g., Node.js, Python, Go, Rust) and choose tooling, add:
  - Build command(s)
  - Lint/format command(s)
  - Test command(s), including how to run a single test/spec
  - Any dev server commands
- Summarize the big-picture architecture only (key modules/services and their responsibilities). Avoid listing every file.
